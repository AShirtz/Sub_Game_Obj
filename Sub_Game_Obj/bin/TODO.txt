	Health.java - 22
	//TODO: this method is implementation specific to the int model of health
	
	GameMap.java - 80
	//TODO: this will draw the map and then call the Player Character to draw
	
	Explosion.java - 27
	//TODO: the '10' is currently arbitrary, make it a variable, measured in number of 'onTurn()'s
	
	EnemyShip.java - 17
	//TODO: this is for simple testing purposes, the second int is the timer.

/*
TODO:
1. Have explosions reduce the health of the ship caught in them
2. have ships with no health be removed from game

DONE: 
1. make sure the onTurn() method is correctly making it to the right objects
2. make it that Events are removed after one turn of being active
3. have weapons be removed after they are detonated
4. Ships respond to Events accordingly
